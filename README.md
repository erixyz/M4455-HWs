# M4455-HWs
a collection of my Math 445 HWs from CSUN. written in RMD for the most part using LaTex and R.

# Description

a collection of the HW assignments completed over the course of a semester for my data science course in undergrad at CSUN. a great class that sparked my interest in analyzing data and mathematical modelling. i'd like to thank CSUN's mathematics department and Dr. Zambom for being a great professor and for the knowledge he shared.
